As the seas rose and the rivers flooded, crops failed and unrest threatened to tear the United States apart politically. No single government body could step in and help coordinate the crisis. But a new engineering firm specializing in ecological risk mitigation made the US government an option: Let us fix your problem, or get your money back. The Trans-Mississippi Recovery Initiative was given over to the American Reclamation Corporation, from the first shovel in the dirt to the ongoing crop cycling in the Midwest. No one can argue with the results - dust storms no longer rock Tennessee, for example - and the ARC is the biggest thing in America these days. Employing a full 23% of the population, with perhaps as much as 85% of the US relying on the ARC for their business, the business of America is the business of the ARC."

Given its material advantages and the pressure from a large population with limited land, PAC took a leading role in the colonization effort, building a space station under the auspices of its Manned Space Engineering Office that would serve as the prototype for the first orbital colony ship spacedocks. Just one decade later, a Chinese crew made the first manned landing on Mars, following mapping by the Yinghou satellite network. Although given urgency by the discovery of the Inflection Point, the establishment of viable and self-sufficient settlements on alien worlds had always been a goal of the PAC Space Agency. In the years following, multiple PAC missions scattered in various directions into the galaxy, with as yet unknown results."

COMESA involvement in the new Africa eventually turned to tapping its prodigious natural and agricultural resources, while attempting to maintain its ecological diversity and heritage through extensive wildlife parks and natural wonders. Funded projects included dams, new energy sources such as wind-farms, and coastal and Congolese reclamation efforts. The African Common Market also invested heavily in education for the post-Mistake generations and in humanitarian projects, notably in the realms of health care and human rights. New industries were pursued, and the Union became one of the major players in international trade.

While it may be facile to claim that it takes a village to raise a child, it may be said with certainty that it takes a village to survive as a colony on a distant world.

The Directorate-General for Education and Culture was aggressive in promoting and exporting European cultural works – especially through the media – to the rest of the world. For Franco-Iberians, their shared cultural history and the cultural infusion from North Africa has become a source of unifying pride. With such initiatives and stability, it is unsurprising that others sought to join Franco-Iberia in the face of a confusing and threatening world.

Tunis is a shimmering resort city to the world, whose nightclubs and cafes thrum with the sound of a new generation of musicians. With such advantages, Franco-Iberia was a leading member in the race for off-world colonies.

Millions of refugees poured across India and surrounding nations in the greatest human migration on the subcontinent since the partition in 1947. Clashes between political and religious factions among desperate groups increased, and the centralized political power had only limited ability to help.

Thakur's message of the great potential of all people, the purifying power of sustainable living, and personal charity did what no political force could - it crossed religious and ethnic boundaries and united the people of the subcontinent. It became a political force of its own, a deeply felt grassroots movement that vanquished the worst of the religious, political, and ethnic violence. Thakur undertook a pilgrimage across the subcontinent on foot, leaving Delhi and walking to the Kush, followed by tens of thousands of his disciples, and a media captivated by the prophet. Arriving in the foothills of the Hindu Kush, Thakur and his followers' tent encampment became a nexus for his teachings, spreading around the world in person and on the Internet and television. His image and words were ubiquitous, bringing solace and care to the poor and diseased, and inspiring many of the upper classes to leave the security of their walled compounds to directly help others."

Raj Thakur's teachings and parables often used the imagery of flight and cosmic travel, and Kavitha Thakur has codified these as explicit support for the Seeding.

Critics demanded transparency behind the agency’s funding sources; however, Korean officials refused to act. Whether or not this was from internal or external pressures is still unknown. What is known is that Korean society was surprisingly well prepared to handle the Great Mistake. Even before the Great Mistake, Chungsu was in a difficult predicament. Between Japan’s isolationism, and China’s unstoppable growth, the Korean peninsula walked a very fine and finite line. The Great Mistake eased Chinese aggression, but it wasn’t until Japan suffered unrecoverable damage to its infrastructure during the Hareubang Tsunami that Chungsu was able to escape its untenable situation. A recovery effort led by Chungsu helped paint the secretive organization in a more positive light domestically, albeit not internationally. The failure of centralized government and the vacuum of localized power allowed the Chungsu to step in and take matters into its own hands."

Franco-Iberia was using outdated ideas for contemporary issues; focusing on growth when they should be enforcing austerity measures; being irresponsible in the wake of a global catastrophe. While early Franco-Iberia had pledged to tackle environmental issues, it was the first item to be shelved. Seizing the opportunity, the INTEGR had found their tent-pole."

While originating in Germany, the fledgling party’s radical agenda quickly garnered support in neighboring countries.

What most didn’t realize, is that this was just the beginning of aggressive legislation aimed at fixing Europe’s problems. INTEGR embraced experimental and expensive, but ultimately more advanced, technologies characterized by their sustainability, environmental preservation, and concern for long-term human habitation on Earth. Proposals from the founding members of INTEGR were considered the most advanced and progressive Europe had ever seen. Their tenants revolved around creating the possibility space for diverse worldviews. No society was too small, no voice insignificant. Sustainability came from innovation, and innovation through diversity. This was the same ethos that ultimately led Lena Ebner and the party to its mission of Transmodernism."

Drawing on their common heritage as naval powers and recognizing the need for cooperation at scale, the North Sea nations formed a groundbreaking partnership dedicated to territorial preservation and the development of co-aquatic habitation and agriculture. As the world settled into its post-Mistake dark age, the new North Sea Alliance was hard at work on massive infrastructure projects in an effort to save their shrinking homelands. London and Copenhagen were reshaped from the waterline up, re-established on elaborate networks of dykes, culverts, and canals; new heavy industries were developed to build and maintain hybrid land-water habitats; and the Scandinavian fjords were dredged and fitted with locks to form massive natural drydocks for the construction of huge, semi-mobile aquatic city platforms. Colloquially called the 'ARKs,' the microecology, aquaculture, and autonomous power production technologies developed to sustain these floating cities were some of the earliest and most visionary artificial environment technologies ever seen, and formed the basis for many new technologies employed in first colony ships to equip them for long-term establishment on foreign planets."

However, the Alliance wasted no time in shifting that emphasis to joining the race to find a new world. Leveraging their autonomous habitation technologies in a series of shrewd partnerships and resource deals, the Alliance managed to ramp up surprisingly quickly – and they did so with one special tactical play based on their unique advantage: their colony ships would be designed to make a water landing, transforming into an ARK-city and giving the fledgling North Sea colony a unique territorial edge in establishing itself in competition with its new neighbors. Though this added sophistication meant they were among the last to launch a colony ship, by the time the Seeding waned they had commissioned more than enough to count among the major colonization sponsors."
